Nodimo
======

Nodimo generalizes dimensional relationships between variables by turning them
into nondimensional expressions. It supports any number of dimensions and variables
and can be used for applications in science, engineering, economics and finance.
The resulting nondimensional functions can be used as the basis for further studies
in similarity and model testing.
