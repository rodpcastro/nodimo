Nodimo
======

Nodimo generalizes a dimensional relationship between variables by turning it
into a nondimensional expression. It supports any number of dimensions and variables
and can be used for applications in science, engineering, economics and finance.
The resulting nondimensional functions can be used as the basis for further studies
in similarity and model testing.
