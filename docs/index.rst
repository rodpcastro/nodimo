Nodimo
======

Nodimo generalizes a dimensional relationship between quantities by turning it into a
dimensionless expression. It supports any number of quantities and dimensions and can
be used for applications in science, engineering, economics and finance. The resulting
dimensionless relations can be used as the basis for further studies in similarity and
model testing.

.. note::
   The use of Nodimo requires basic knowledge of `dimensional analysis`_, specially on
   choosing the appropriate set of scaling parameters and indentifying established
   dimensionless groups. 

.. note::
   It is recommended the use of `jupyter notebook`_ for a better displaying of the
   results.
